# Cool-Input-Method-Considering-Autocomplete

This script provides a unique way to input text into any application, especially designed for environments where autocomplete and auto-indentation features are present. By using this method, you can ensure that the text is input one character at a time, bypassing any autocomplete or auto-indentation features that might otherwise interfere with the input.

Features
Bypass Autocomplete: The script types out text one character at a time, ensuring that autocomplete features in most applications don't get triggered.

Disable Auto-Indentation: By moving to the beginning of the next line using the arrow key instead of the enter key, the script avoids triggering auto-indentation in many text editors or IDEs.

Quick Termination: You can quickly terminate the script at any point by pressing the Esc key.

How to Use
Copy Text: Copy the text you want to input using Ctrl + C.

Start Typing: Activate the typing mode by pressing Ctrl + M. The script will start typing out the copied text one character at a time.

Terminate: If you wish to stop the script at any point, simply press the Esc key.

Requirements
Python
keyboard library: Used for detecting key presses and simulating keyboard input.
pyperclip library: Used for accessing the clipboard to get the copied text.
Installation
Install the required Python libraries:

Copy code
pip install keyboard pyperclip
Run the script:

Copy code
python script_name.py
Replace script_name.py with the name you've saved the script as.
